PS  
if you are on Windows like me, highly recommend to use nvm-windows to install node [detailed instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows):
1. download and install nvm (https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
2. `nvm install latest`
3. `nvm ls`
4. `nvm use 00.0.0` (insert the version number from previous step)
